**Food brands are removing customer service numbers from packaging to reduce costs, streamline support, and shift consumers toward digital feedback channels like QR code forms.** This change reflects broader trends in mobile-first engagement, automation, and real-time analytics.

## Why Customer Service Numbers Are Disappearing from Food Packaging

### 1. **Low Usage and ROI**
Most consumers rarely call customer service numbers printed on packaging. A Reddit thread confirms that calls are infrequent and often driven by unusual circumstances like mislabeled products. Maintaining phone support for such low engagement is costly and inefficient.

### 2. **Cost Reduction**
Brands are quietly eliminating phone numbers, live chat, and direct email support to cut operational costs. This shift outsources problem-solving to consumers via self-service tools like FAQ pages and AI chatbots. Removing phone support reduces staffing needs and infrastructure expenses.

### 3. **Shift to Digital Feedback**
Modern consumers prefer mobile-first, asynchronous communication. QR codes on packaging link directly to feedback forms, allowing brands to collect structured data without human intervention. This method is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than phone support.

### 4. **Real-Time Analytics**
Phone calls offer anecdotal feedback with no easy way to quantify or segment responses. QR code forms—especially those built with tools like FabForm.io—enable:

- Timestamped responses
- Product-specific feedback
- Exportable datasets
- Integration with CRM and analytics platforms

### 5. **Better UX for Consumers**
Calling a support line involves wait times, IVR menus, and potential frustration. In contrast, scanning a QR code and answering one question at a time is intuitive, fast, and mobile-optimized. This improves the overall customer experience and increases feedback volume.

### 6. **Packaging Space Optimization**
Removing phone numbers frees up label space for more relevant content: QR codes, nutritional info, sustainability messaging, or promotional CTAs. Brands can use packaging real estate more strategically.

- **Embedding QR codes** linked to branded feedback forms
- **Using dynamic QR codes** to update form links without reprinting packaging
- **Offering incentives** (e.g., coupons) for completed feedback
- **Integrating feedback into product development cycles**
