# The Surprisingly Smart Way to Get Feedback: QR Codes on Receipts

Let’s be honest—most receipts end up crumpled in pockets, tossed in bins, or used to wipe ketchup off a toddler’s face. But what if that little slip of paper could actually help you improve your business?

Adding a QR code to your receipt that links to a one-question feedback form is one of the simplest, most scalable ways to collect customer insights. It’s fast, discreet, and doesn’t require anyone to download an app or remember a URL. Just scan, tap, done.

## Why Receipts Are Secretly the Best Feedback Channel

Receipts are printed constantly. Whether you run a coffee shop, salon, retail store, or restaurant, you’re handing out thousands of them every month. That’s thousands of chances to ask: “How was your experience?”

And because the receipt lands in the customer’s hand right after the transaction, it’s the perfect moment to catch honest, in-the-moment feedback. No follow-up emails. No awkward surveys. Just a quick scan and a single question.

## What Makes QR Code Feedback Forms So Effective?

- **They’re mobile-friendly**  
  Most people already have their phone out. A QR code that leads to a fast-loading form (like FabForm.io) feels natural.

- **They’re frictionless**  
  No login, no multi-step survey. Just one question. “How was your visit?” “Was the service friendly?” “Did your order arrive on time?”

- **They’re customizable**  
  With FabForm, you can brand your form, choose your question, and even redirect users to a thank-you page or promo code after they submit.

- **They’re trackable**  
  Want to know which store location gets the best feedback? Use unique QR codes for each branch and compare results.

- **They’re affordable**  
  Unlike some form builders that charge per response or limit branding, FabForm gives you unlimited responses and full control—for a flat, one-time fee.

## How to Set It Up (Without Losing Your Mind)

1. **Create a one-question form in FabForm.io**  
   Keep it simple. “How was your visit today?” works wonders.

2. **Generate a QR code linked to your form**  
   Use any QR generator or FabForm’s built-in tools.

3. **Add the QR code to your receipt template**  
   Position it near the bottom with a friendly prompt like:  
   *“Tell us how we did—scan here. It takes 5 seconds, promise.”*

4. **Test it on your phone**  
   Make sure it loads fast and looks clean. FabForm’s forms are built for mobile, so you’re covered.

5. **Track responses by location or staff**  
   Want to know how your Saturday crew compares to your weekday team? Use separate QR codes and see what the data says.

## Real-World Use Cases

- **Retail stores**: “Was our staff helpful today?”  
- **Restaurants**: “How was your meal?”  
- **Delivery services**: “Did your order arrive on time?”  
- **Salons and spas**: “Were you happy with your service?”  
- **Coffee shops**: “How was your drink?”  
- **Boutique brands**: “Did you love your purchase?”

These are all subtle ways to collect customer feedback using QR codes on receipts—without annoying anyone or sounding like a corporate robot.
