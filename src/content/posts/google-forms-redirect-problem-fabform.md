# The Google Forms Redirect Problem — And Why Fabform Is the Fix

If you’ve ever tried to set up a **redirect after submission in Google Forms**, you already know the frustration: it simply isn’t possible. Google Forms forces every user to land on a generic confirmation page, leaving you with no control over what happens next. For marketers, creators, and businesses, this is more than an inconvenience — it’s a conversion killer.

## The Redirect Problem With Google Forms
- **No automatic redirects**: You can’t send users to a thank‑you page, upsell, or gated content.  
- **Dead‑end confirmations**: The default “Your response has been recorded” page stops the user journey cold.  
- **Lost opportunities**: Every form submission could be a chance to engage further, but Google Forms blocks that path.

## How Fabform Solves It
- **Instant redirects**: Fabform lets you send users straight to any page after submission — thank‑you, download, checkout, or calendar invite.  
- **Conditional logic**: Redirect based on answers, so each user gets a personalized journey.  
- **Brand control**: No Google branding, just your own design and messaging.  
- **Conversion focus**: Every form is built to move users forward, not leave them stuck.

## Real‑World Example
Imagine you’re collecting leads for a webinar.  
- With Google Forms, users hit the redirect problem: a dead‑end confirmation page.  
- With Fabform, you can redirect them to a **calendar invite**, a **downloadable guide**, or even a **checkout flow** for upsells.  

That’s the difference between a form that just collects data and a form that drives conversions.

If you’re serious about marketing, growth, and user experience, you need a tool that works for you, not against you.
