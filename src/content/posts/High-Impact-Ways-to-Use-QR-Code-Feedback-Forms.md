## 📲 Why QR Code Feedback Forms Are the Smartest Post-Purchase Move You’ll Make

You’ve nailed the sale. Now what? If you’re not capturing feedback while the experience is fresh, you’re missing out on insights that could shape your next win. Enter: **QR code feedback forms**—the simplest way to turn customer thoughts into growth.

### 🚀 Instant Access, Zero Friction
QR codes eliminate the usual barriers to feedback. No login, no app, no friction. Just a quick scan and your customer is sharing their thoughts while the experience is still top of mind.

- **Scan-to-share**: Customers use their phone camera—no typing URLs or digging through emails.
- **Real-time reactions**: Capture feedback at peak relevance, whether it’s delight or a hiccup you can fix fast.

### 🧠 Smarter Data, Better Decisions
QR feedback forms aren’t just easy—they’re strategic. You get clean, structured data that’s ready to act on.

- **Tag-based segmentation**: Track feedback by product, location, or campaign.
- **Dynamic routing**: Use different QR codes for different SKUs or service tiers to tailor the form experience.

### 💬 Higher Engagement, Happier Customers
Customers are more likely to respond when it’s quick, casual, and feels like a conversation—not a chore.

- **Ultra-minimal forms**: 2–3 questions max. Think: “How did we do?” not “Rate us on 17 metrics.”
- **Casual copy**: “Got a sec? Scan to share your thoughts.” feels human, not corporate.

### 🛍️ Physical-Digital Bridge
QR codes live where your product does—on packaging, receipts, thank-you cards, or even the product itself.

- **In-store to online**: Bridge the gap between physical purchases and digital feedback.
- **Post-purchase delight**: Include a QR code with a thank-you message or setup guide, then ask for feedback once they’ve had a chance to use it.

### 🔧 Built-In QR Generator with FabForm
No extra tools, no clunky integrations. FabForm includes a **built-in QR code generator** for every form—so you can go from idea to scan-ready in seconds.

- **Auto-generated QR codes**: Every form gets one. Just download and drop it into your packaging or email.
- **No setup required**: It’s baked in. Just create your form and grab the code.

### 📈 Bonus: SEO & Retargeting Potential
With the right setup, QR feedback forms can feed your marketing engine too.

- **Collect emails (with consent)** for follow-ups or loyalty programs.
- **Optimize form metadata** for long-tail search like “FabForm feedback” or “Typeform alternative review.”
