# Why Typeform Is So Expensive—and Why FabForm.io Is the Smarter Alternative

If you’ve ever tried building a form with Typeform, you’ve probably hit a wall: limited free usage, steep monthly fees, and basic features locked behind expensive tiers. Typeform’s sleek design is appealing, but its pricing model leaves many users frustrated—especially startups, marketers, and developers who need flexibility without recurring costs.

Let’s break down why Typeform feels overpriced, and why [FabForm.io](https://fabform.io) is quickly becoming the go-to alternative.

## Typeform’s Pricing: What You’re Really Paying For

Typeform’s pricing is built around usage limits, branding removal, and gated features. Even modest form activity can push you into higher tiers.

### Limited Free Tier

- Only 100 responses per month
- Mandatory Typeform branding
- No custom domains or advanced logic

### Paid Plans Escalate Quickly

| Plan | Monthly Cost | Response Limit | Branding Removal | Custom Domain |
|------|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Basic | $25 | 100 | No | No |
| Plus | $59.50 | 1,000 | Yes | Yes |
| Business | $99.83 | 10,000 | Yes | Yes |

Enterprise plans are even higher and often require negotiation. For many users, the jump from free to paid feels abrupt—and the value doesn’t scale proportionally.

## Feature Gating and Hidden Costs

Even at higher tiers, Typeform restricts access to features that many competitors offer by default:

- **Conditional logic**: Only available on paid plans
- **Analytics and integrations**: Limited unless you upgrade
- **Branding removal**: Requires Plus or Business tier
- **Custom domains**: Not available on Basic
- **Team collaboration**: Costs extra

This gating model forces users to pay more for basic functionality—especially frustrating for small teams and solo creators.

## Market Sentiment: Users Are Looking Elsewhere

Across Reddit, Hacker News, and SaaS forums, users consistently voice frustration with Typeform’s pricing:

- “Feels like I’m paying for the design, not the functionality.”
- “I just need a simple form without branding—why is that $60/month?”
- “The free tier is basically a trial. You hit the limit in days.”

Many are actively searching for alternatives that offer clean UX, backend control, and predictable pricing.
